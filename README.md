# Modeling-and-Simulation-of-Cyber-Physical-Digital-Twin
Designed and implemented a Cyber-Physical Digital Twin (CPDT) framework using MATLAB Simulink and Arduino for real-time fault detection and protection in a 3-bus IEEE system. Achieved fault detection within 0.2 seconds with a synchronization latency of 20 ms, ensuring improved system reliability and resilience.
