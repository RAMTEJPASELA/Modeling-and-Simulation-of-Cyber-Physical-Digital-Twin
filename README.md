# âš¡ Modeling and Simulation of a Cyber-Physical Digital Twin (CPDT) for Bus Fault Management 

This project presents a **Cyber-Physical Digital Twin (CPDT)** framework designed using **MATLAB Simulink** and **Arduino** for real-time fault detection and protection in a simulated **3-bus IEEE system**. By leveraging **positive sequence current component analysis**, the system effectively detects and identifies faults, enabling swift and precise fault isolation. The integration of Arduino hardware and LEDs provides a practical demonstration of the fault detection and response process, enhancing its educational and operational value.  

The framework achieves fault detection within **0.2 seconds** with a synchronization latency of **20 ms**, ensuring reliable and efficient real-time operation. This rapid response time significantly reduces fault propagation risks, making the system ideal for smart grid applications. Additionally, real-time data is monitored and analyzed, contributing to faster decision-making and improved resilience of modern power systems.  

By applying advanced fault detection and protection mechanisms, this project offers a scalable solution for grid management. It demonstrates the practical benefits of using Cyber-Physical Digital Twins to enhance fault detection accuracy and operational efficiency. The successful implementation of this framework highlights its potential for further adaptation in real-world energy infrastructure.
